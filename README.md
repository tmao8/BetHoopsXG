# NBA_Player_Prediction

Using NBA_API, this python application uses up-to-date NBA data to train a random forest model using XGBoost. This model utilizes both quantatative and qualitative data to predict NBA player's performance based on stats from this NBA season. In addition, this application aquires betting lines from PrizePicks, and projects whether to go over/under on these lines.
